## 🔐 Social Media Authentication

The app includes a comprehensive social media verification system:

### Supported Platforms
- Instagram
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X
- Google

### Verification Flow
1. User clicks "Connect" button for a social platform
2. OAuth flow initiates (currently mocked for demo)
3. User authorizes the application
4. Profile URL is retrieved and stored
5. Verified badge is displayed on user profile

### Implementation Notes
- OAuth flows are currently mocked for demonstration
- Ready for backend integration with real OAuth providers
- Secure token handling and profile verification
- Error handling for failed authentications

## 📊 Database Integration

The app is configured to work with Supabase:

- **Authentication**: Email/password with OTP verification
- **Real-time**: Ready for real-time messaging
- **Storage**: Profile pictures and post media
- **Database**: User profiles, posts, messages, social accounts

The `profiles` table also stores optional `latitude` and `longitude` fields for
local discovery. These coordinates are cleared on logout and automatically
removed if they haven't been updated in five minutes. A sample edge function for
this scheduled cleanup lives in `supabase/functions/cleanup-stale-locations`.

### Messaging Flow
Messages are stored in the `messages` table. When you start a conversation from the Radar screen the app automatically switches to the Messages tab and loads the chat history from Supabase.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables for Production
Make sure to set these in your deployment platform:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Progressive Web App
The project is configured as a PWA using `next-pwa`. When built for production, the app can be installed on mobile devices and works offline.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Messaging** - WebSocket integration
- **Push Notifications** - Mobile notifications
- **Advanced Filtering** - Enhanced user discovery
- **Content Moderation** - Automated content filtering
- **Analytics Dashboard** - User engagement metrics
- **Premium Features** - Subscription-based enhancements
