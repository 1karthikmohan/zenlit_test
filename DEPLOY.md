# Zenlit Mobile App Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps to build, test, and deploy the Zenlit Next.js PWA as a native mobile application using Capacitor.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm installed
- Xcode (for iOS development) and Android Studio (for Android development) installed
- Java Development Kit (JDK) for Android development
- Your system configured for Android and iOS development (e.g., Android SDK, environment variables)

## üõ† Local Development & Testing

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install all project dependencies, including Capacitor:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Initialize Capacitor (First Time Only)

If you haven't already, initialize Capacitor and add the native platforms. This will create the `android/` and `ios/` folders.

```bash
npm run cap:init
npm run cap:add-android
npm run cap:add-ios
```

Or run the commands directly:

```bash
npx cap init Zenlit com.zenlit.social
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
```

### 3. Generate Native Assets (Icons & Splash Screens)

Ensure you have `public/icon-512x512.png` as your base icon.
Generate the native assets:

```bash
npm run cap:generate-assets
```

Or run directly:

```bash
npx @capacitor/resources generate --icon public/icon-512x512.png --splash public/apple-splash-2048-2732.png
```

*Note: If you have other specific splash screen images, you might need to manually place them in the respective platform folders.*

### 4. Build and Copy Web Assets to Native Projects

This command will:
- Build your Next.js application for production
- Export the static files to the `out/` directory
- Copy these static files into the native projects

```bash
npm run build:cap
```

### 5. Open Native Projects in IDEs

To work with the native projects, open them in their respective IDEs:

**Android Studio:**
```bash
npm run cap:open-android
```

**Xcode (for iOS):**
```bash
npm run cap:open-ios
```

### 6. Run on Device/Emulator with Live Reload

For development, you can run the app on a device or emulator with live reload enabled:

**Android:**
```bash
npm run cap:run-android
```

**iOS:**
```bash
npm run cap:run-ios
```

*Note: For live reload to work, ensure your development server is accessible from your device/emulator.*

## üì¶ App Store Readiness

Before submitting to app stores, ensure the following configurations are in place:

### iOS Configuration (`ios/App/App/Info.plist`)

Open `Info.plist` in Xcode and verify/add:

- **Bundle Identifier**: `com.zenlit.social`
- **Bundle Name**: `Zenlit`
- **Privacy Usage Descriptions**: Add entries for permissions your app uses:
  ```xml
  <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Zenlit needs access to your location to find nearby users.</string>
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Zenlit needs camera access to allow you to take photos for posts.</string>
  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Zenlit needs access to your photo library to select images for posts.</string>
  ```

### Android Configuration (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)

Open `AndroidManifest.xml` in Android Studio and verify/add:

- **Package Name**: The `package` attribute should be `com.zenlit.social`
- **Application Label**: The `android:label` should be `Zenlit`
- **Permissions**: Add necessary permissions within the `<manifest>` tag:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  ```

### Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

Ensure your `public/policy.html` and `public/terms.html` files contain your actual, complete Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. These URLs will be required during app store submission.

## üöÄ Generating Signed Builds for Submission

### Android

1. **Generate a Signed APK/App Bundle**:
   - Open your Android project in Android Studio (`npm run cap:open-android`)
   - Go to `Build` > `Generate Signed Bundle / APK...`
   - Select `Android App Bundle` (recommended for Play Store)
   - Create a new Key Store if you don't have one, or use an existing one
   - **Keep your keystore file and password safe!**
   - Follow the prompts to generate the signed build

### iOS

1. **Configure Signing & Capabilities**:
   - Open your iOS project in Xcode (`npm run cap:open-ios`)
   - Select your project in the Project Navigator
   - Go to the `Signing & Capabilities` tab
   - Select your Team and ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked
   - Add any required capabilities if your app uses them

2. **Archive for Distribution**:
   - Select `Any iOS Device (arm64)` as the target device
   - Go to `Product` > `Archive`
   - Once complete, the Organizer window will appear
   - Select your archive and click `Distribute App`
   - Choose `App Store Connect` and follow the prompts

## üîß Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Update your Next.js code** as usual
2. **Build and sync** with native projects:
   ```bash
   npm run build:cap
   npm run cap:sync
   ```
3. **Test on device/emulator**:
   ```bash
   npm run cap:run-android
   # or
   npm run cap:run-ios
   ```

### Debugging

- **Android**: Use Chrome DevTools by navigating to `chrome://inspect` while your app is running
- **iOS**: Use Safari Web Inspector by enabling it in Safari's Develop menu
